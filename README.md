SafetyChex: an IOC scanner that checks an endpoint against all available IOC online in .py


SafetyChex currently has a URL scan function and endpoint scan function to scan an URL or endpoint for all known IOC found online in major security sources.
Alienvault, Krebbs, fire eye, etc.

SafetyChex is developed by abtzpro, Adam R, and HelloSecurity

Changes to come: The ability to choose from most major email providers, sign in, and have an email notification sent to the chosen email address when scanning is complete with included remediation information if publicly available.
