# SafetyChex
SafetyChex: an IOC scanner that checks an endpoint against all available IOC online in .py


SafetyChex currently has a URL scan function to scan a URL for all known IOC found online in major security sources.
Alienvault, Krebbs, fire eye, etc.

SafetyChex is devloped by abtzpro, Adam R, and HelloSecurity

Changes to come: 
The ability to add a chosen endpoint added to the code as a prompt issued to the user at script runtime.

The ability to add and customize IOC provider sources as a setup text based prompt at script runtime.

The ability to choose an email provider and sign in for alerts when an IOC has been found on the scanned endpoint.

The ability to remediate when possible as a text based prompt when an IOC is found.
